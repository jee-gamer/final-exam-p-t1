- The way to run program is very simple, you just run the polygon_art.py and there will be a prompt to input number between 1 to 8, if you enter number outside of this range it will print something and let you enter the number again
- I have implemented all the code 
- You haven't specified the numbers of the polygon generated on screen so I counted and I see about 30 polygon per screen which is what I use as a standard number for this class.
- Potential bug
- I dont know how to get the turtle to disappear, in the original file you made the background black so that I couldn't see the turtle at first but after that I see that it is still there, I tried to pen up an pen down but the turtle is still there
